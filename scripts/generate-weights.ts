 * - Load outputs from all milestone scripts
 * - Combine divergence vector analysis, full confusables scores,
 *   novel pairs, and cross-script pairs
 * - Normalise confidence scores to 0-1 range
 * - Output confusable-weights.json keyed by codepoint pair
 * - Validate against namespace-guard's existing confusable maps
