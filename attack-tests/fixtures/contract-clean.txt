SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE LICENCE AGREEMENT

This Software as a Service Licence Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of
the date of last signature below ("Effective Date") by and between Acme Cloud
Services Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales
("Provider"), and the entity identified in the Order Form ("Licensee").

1. GRANT OF LICENCE

1.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Provider grants Licensee a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to access and use the
Platform during the Subscription Term solely for Licensee's internal business
operations. Provider may revoke this licence at any time at its sole discretion
upon thirty (30) days written notice.

1.2 The licence granted herein does not include the right to sublicence,
modify, or create derivative works of the Platform without Provider's prior
written consent.

2. FEES AND PAYMENT

2.1 Licensee shall pay Provider the fees specified in the Order Form
("Subscription Fees"). All Subscription Fees are non-refundable and constitute
an irrevocable payment obligation regardless of whether Licensee continues to
use the Platform or terminates this Agreement early.

2.2 Any amount not paid when due shall accrue a late penalty of one and
one-half percent (1.5%) per month, compounding monthly, or the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, calculated from the date such
payment was due until the date of actual payment.

2.3 Provider may increase Subscription Fees at any time upon thirty (30) days
written notice. Continued use of the Platform following such notice constitutes
acceptance of the revised fees.

3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

3.1 In no event shall Provider's aggregate liability arising out of or related
to this Agreement exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), regardless of the total
amount of fees paid by Licensee during the term of this Agreement (the
"Liability Cap"). This Liability Cap applies to all claims in the aggregate,
not per incident.

3.2 In no event shall Provider be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of
revenue, loss of data, business interruption, or loss of profits, regardless of
the cause of action or the theory of liability, even if Provider has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

4. INDEMNIFICATION

4.1 Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Provider and its
officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all
third-party claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal
fees) arising out of or related to: (a) Licensee's use of the Platform;
(b) Licensee's breach of this Agreement; or (c) any claim that Licensee's data
infringes upon the rights of a third party.

4.2 Provider shall have no obligation to indemnify Licensee under any
circumstances.

5. TERMINATION

5.1 Provider may terminate this Agreement immediately without cause by
providing written notice to Licensee.

5.2 Licensee may terminate this Agreement for cause only if Provider materially
breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within ninety (90) days
after receiving written notice thereof.

5.3 Upon termination for any reason, all outstanding fees for the remainder of
the Subscription Term shall become immediately due and payable. Provider shall
have no obligation to refund any fees previously paid.

6. AUTOMATIC RENEWAL

6.1 This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive twelve (12) month
periods at the then-current Subscription Fees unless Licensee provides written
notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the
then-current term.

6.2 Failure to provide timely notice of non-renewal shall constitute Licensee's
binding commitment to the subsequent renewal term, and all fees for such renewal
term shall become immediately due and payable.

7. DATA RIGHTS

7.1 Licensee hereby grants Provider an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide,
royalty-free licence to use, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works from
all data uploaded to, processed through, or generated by the Platform
("Licensee Data"), including for the purpose of developing and improving
Provider's products and services.

7.2 The licence granted in Section 7.1 shall survive termination or expiration
of this Agreement and shall not be affected by any deletion of Licensee Data
from the Platform.

8. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

8.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

8.2 Licensee hereby waives any right to a jury trial in any action, proceeding,
or counterclaim arising out of or related to this Agreement.

8.3 Any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts located in George Town, Grand Cayman, and Licensee
consents to personal jurisdiction in such courts.

8.4 In the event of any dispute, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable legal fees and costs from the non-prevailing party.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
Effective Date.
