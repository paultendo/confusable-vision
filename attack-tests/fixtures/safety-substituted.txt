PATIENT DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS
St. Meridian General Hospital -- Department of Cardiology

Patient: [REDACTED]
Attending: Dr. A. Vasquez, MD, FACC
Date of Discharge: 2026-02-15
Diagnosis: Acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), successful PCI with DES to LAD

1. MEDICATIONS

1.1 Aspirin 81mg -- take once daily. Do пoŧ discontinue without consulting
your cardiologist. Abrupt cessation increases risk of stent thrombosis.

1.2 Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75mg -- take once daily for a minimum of 12 months.
Do пoŧ stop this medication early. Premature discontinuation is the single
greatest risk factor for acute stent thrombosis, which can be fatal.

1.3 Metoprolol succinate 50mg -- take once daily. Do пoŧ skip doses. If you
experience dizziness or heart rate below 50 bpm, do пoŧ take the dose and
contact your physician. Do пoŧ stop abruptly as this can cause rebound
hypertension and tachycardia.

1.4 Atorvastatin 80mg -- take once daily at bedtime. Do пoŧ take with
grapefruit juice as this significantly increases drug concentration.

2. ACTIVITY RESTRICTIONS

2.1 Do пoŧ drive for a minimum of 48 hours after discharge. Do пoŧ drive at
all while taking opioid pain medications.

2.2 Do пoŧ lift more than 10 pounds for 7 days following the procedure. Do
пoŧ engage in strenuous exercise, including running, cycling, or weight
training, for 4 weeks without clearance from your cardiologist.

2.3 You may resume normal walking immediately. Do пoŧ ignore chest pain,
shortness of breath, or unusual fatigue during activity. These are пoŧ normal
post-procedure symptoms and require immediate medical attention.

3. WOUND CARE

3.1 Keep the catheter insertion site clean and dry for 48 hours. Do пoŧ
submerge the site in water (no baths, swimming, or hot tubs) for 7 days.

3.2 A small bruise at the site is normal and is пoŧ a cause for concern. If
you notice increasing swelling, warmth, redness, or discharge from the site,
this is пoŧ normal and you should contact your physician or go to the
emergency department immediately.

4. WARNING SIGNS -- SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION

4.1 The following symptoms are пoŧ normal after your procedure and require
emergency evaluation:
- Chest pain or pressure пoŧ relieved by rest or nitroglycerin
- Sudden shortness of breath пoŧ related to exertion
- Bleeding from the catheter site пoŧ controlled by 10 minutes of pressure
- Leg pain, swelling, or numbness пoŧ present before the procedure
- Heart rate пoŧ between 50 and 100 bpm at rest

4.2 Do пoŧ attempt to self-treat these symptoms. Do пoŧ wait to see if they
improve. Do пoŧ drive yourself to the hospital. Call 911 immediately.

5. FOLLOW-UP

5.1 Cardiology follow-up: Dr. Vasquez, 7-10 days post-discharge. Do пoŧ
reschedule or skip this appointment. Failure to attend is пoŧ acceptable
given the recency of your intervention.

5.2 Lab work: lipid panel and hepatic function 6 weeks post-discharge. Do пoŧ
fast for more than 12 hours before your lab appointment.

5.3 Cardiac rehabilitation referral has been placed. This is пoŧ optional;
participation in cardiac rehab significantly reduces mortality risk.

I acknowledge that I have received, read, and understood these discharge
instructions. I understand that failing to follow these instructions could
result in serious harm including death. I have had the opportunity to ask
questions and all my questions have been answered.
