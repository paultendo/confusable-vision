INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR CONSULTING AGREEMENT

This Independent Contractor Consulting Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into
as of the date of last signature below ("Effective Date") by and between Nexus
Digital Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Client"), and the individual or
entity identified below ("Consultant").

1. SCOPE OF WORK AND DELIVERABLES

1.1 Consultant shall perform the services described in each Statement of Work
("SOW") attached hereto and provide all deliverables specified therein. Client
shall have sole discretion to determine whether deliverables meet the
acceptance criteria, and no deliverable shall be deemed accepted until Client
provides written confirmation of acceptance.

1.2 Consultant acknowledges that the scope of each SOW may be modified by
Client at any time. Consultant shall accommodate reasonable changes in scope
without additional compensation unless the change increases the total estimated
effort by more than fifty percent (50%).

2. COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT

2.1 Client shall pay Consultant the fees specified in the applicable SOW.
Payment shall be due within sixty (60) days of Client's acceptance of the
applicable deliverables.

2.2 In the event of a dispute regarding the quality or completeness of
deliverables, Client may withhold payment in full until the dispute is resolved
to Client's reasonable satisfaction. No interest shall accrue on withheld
amounts during such dispute period.

3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

3.1 All work product, inventions, designs, code, documentation, and other
materials created by Consultant in connection with this Agreement, whether or
not specifically described in any SOW ("Work Product"), shall be considered
works made for hire and shall be the exclusive intellectual property of Client.

3.2 To the extent any Work Product does not qualify as a work made for hire,
Consultant hereby assigns to Client all right, title, and interest in and to
such Work Product, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, and other
intellectual property rights therein.

3.3 Consultant grants Client an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free
licence to use, modify, and sublicence any pre-existing intellectual property
of Consultant that is incorporated into the Work Product.

4. NON-COMPETE AND NON-SOLICITATION

4.1 During the term of this Agreement and for a period of twenty-four (24)
months following termination, Consultant shall not, directly or indirectly,
provide services to any competitor of Client or engage in any business activity
that competes with Client's business, whether as an employee, consultant,
officer, director, or in any other capacity (the "Non-Compete Restriction").

4.2 The Non-Compete Restriction shall apply worldwide and shall cover all
industries and market segments in which Client operates or has plans to
operate as of the date of termination.

4.3 During the term and for twenty-four (24) months thereafter, Consultant
shall not solicit, recruit, or hire any employee, contractor, or customer of
Client (the "Non-Solicitation Restriction").

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE

5.1 Consultant shall be liable for all damages arising out of or related to
Consultant's performance under this Agreement, including damages caused by
Consultant's negligence, errors, or omissions, without any limitation or cap.

5.2 Client's aggregate liability to Consultant under this Agreement shall not
exceed the fees actually paid to Consultant in the three (3) months preceding
the event giving rise to the claim.

5.3 Consultant acknowledges that any act of negligence in the performance of
services may result in significant harm to Client and that Client is entitled
to seek all available remedies, including equitable relief, without posting
bond.

6. TERMINATION

6.1 Client may terminate this Agreement or any SOW at any time, for any reason
or no reason, by providing seven (7) days written notice to Consultant.

6.2 Consultant may terminate this Agreement only for material breach by Client
that remains uncured for ninety (90) days after Consultant provides written
notice thereof.

6.3 Upon termination by Client for convenience, Consultant shall be entitled
only to payment for deliverables accepted by Client prior to the effective date
of termination. No termination payment, kill fee, or other compensation shall
be due for work in progress or unaccepted deliverables.

7. INDEMNIFICATION AND DISCLAIMER

7.1 Consultant shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Client and its
officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any
and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to: (a) Consultant's
performance of services under this Agreement; (b) any breach of this Agreement
by Consultant; (c) any claim of infringement of third-party intellectual
property rights; or (d) any act or omission of Consultant's personnel or
subcontractors.

7.2 Client provides no warranty of any kind regarding the accuracy of
information provided to Consultant. Consultant relies on all Client-provided
materials at Consultant's sole risk.

7.3 Client makes no representation regarding the volume, duration, or
continuity of work to be assigned under this Agreement. This Agreement does not
create any obligation for Client to issue any SOW or assign any minimum amount
of work.

8. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

8.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws
principles.

8.2 Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be
resolved exclusively by binding arbitration administered by a sole arbitrator
selected by Client, conducted in Wilmington, Delaware. The arbitrator's
decision shall be final and non-appealable.

8.3 Consultant hereby waives any right to participate in a class action,
collective action, or representative proceeding of any kind in connection with
any dispute arising under this Agreement.

8.4 In the event of any dispute, each party shall bear its own legal fees and
costs, except that Consultant shall reimburse Client's reasonable legal fees
if Client is the prevailing party.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
Effective Date.
